The rationale of this method is that LM performance should
not be affected by eliminating rare events from the training
sample. Moreover, this method provides large reductions as
rare events constitute the majority of events.

x,y,z are the 3 words of a trigram (or yz for bigram)

only trigrams such that c(xy ) > 10
have been considered for selection.

Frequency based selection - simplest way, (what i have currently implemented)

# back-off
## Some  bigram probabilities are 'weaker' than others.
A way to measure this is probability of resorting to unigrams expressed by Pr(y)Î»(y) 

# Entropy
A way of evaluating the degree of ambiguity of a context.

Sum of probabilities of bigram multiplied by H(wd|wt-1) which is the probability times the log of the probability.

Rational is that trigrams are mostly useful when bigrams provide high entropy or, similarly, high perplexity.
