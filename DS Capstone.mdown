#DS Capstone
============

The capstone will be evaluated based on the following assessments:

1. An introductory quiz to test whether you have downloaded and can manipulate the data.
2. An intermediate R markdown report that describes in plain language, plots, and code your exploratory analysis of the course data set.
3. Two natural language processing quizzes, where you apply your predictive model to real data to check how it is working.
4. A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words), one clicks submit, and it predicts the next word.
5. A 5 slide deck created with R presentations pitching your algorithm and app to your boss or investor.
